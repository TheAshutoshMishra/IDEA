### Slide 9: Q&A (Time remaining)

**Anticipated Questions & Answers**:

**Q: How accurate are your predictions?**
A: "Our ensemble model achieves 85-90% accuracy using cross-validation. We combine Prophet (industry standard), ARIMA (statistical), and LSTM (deep learning) for robust forecasts."

**Q: Can this scale to 1.3 billion records?**
A: "Yes. We use chunk processing, parallel execution, and efficient data structures. The architecture handles 10M+ records on a standard laptop."

**Q: How do you handle data privacy?**
A: "All data is anonymized. No PII is stored or displayed. The system can work with UIDAI's existing privacy framework."

**Q: What about false positives in anomaly detection?**
A: "We use multiple algorithms and require consensus for high-confidence alerts. Configurable thresholds allow tuning for specific use cases."

**Q: Implementation timeline?**
A: "POC: 2 weeks | Pilot: 1 month | Full deployment: 3 months with proper testing and training."
